=================================
ARITHMETIC TYPES
=================================
-All integer types except char, signed char, unsigned char may contain unused bit called padding.

-Padding allows implementations to accommodate hardware quirks such as skipping over a sign bit in the middle of a 
multi word representation, or to optimally align with a target architecture

-the number of bits used to represent a value of a given type, excluding padding but including the sign, is called
the 'WIDTH', often denoted as N.

'PRECISION' is the number of bits used to represent values, excluding sign and padding bits.

-<limits.h> header file provides the min and max representable value for various integer types.
    -representable values are ones that can be represented in the number of bits available
    to an object of that type.

-Values that cannot be represented will be diagnosed by the compiler or converted to a representable
but different (incorrect) value

-max, min and width values are determined by compilers.

-integers are by default signed, except char, chars you can declare as signed or unsigned,
ints you can only declare unsigned or omit.

-'WRAPAROUND' occurs when you perform arithmetic operations that result in values too small or too large
to be represented as a particular unsigned integer type. the value essentially either rollsover to the max or min values
of the type

-Each unsigned integer type has a signed integer type (excluding _Bool) that occupies
the same amount of storage.

-signed types have three signed integer representation schemes:
    -sign and magnitude: the high-order bit indicates the sign, and the remaining bits represent the magnitude
    -one's complement: the sign bit is given the weight (2^(n-1) - 1) other values have the same positive weight
    -two's complement: the sign bit is given the weight 2^(n-1) other values have the same positive weight

-you do not choose which signed representation you use that is determined by the implementer of c for
various systems. two's complement is the most common though.
