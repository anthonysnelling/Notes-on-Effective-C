=================================
OBJECTS AND FUNCTIONS
=================================
-every type in C is either an object or a function type

-An 'object' is storage in which you can represent values
or precisely: "a region of data storage in the execution environment, the contents
of which can represent values. When  referenced, an object can be interpreted as 
having a particular type."

- Variables have a declared type that tells you the kind of object its value represent.

-Functions are NOT objects, but do have types, Characterized by both its return type and the 
number of and types of its parameters.

=================================
POINTERS
=================================
- C also has pointers, which can be thought of as an address- a location in memory where
an object or function is stored.

-A Pointer type is derived from a function or object type called the referenced type. 
A pointer type derived from the referenced type 'T' is called a 'pointer' to 'T'

-objects and functions are different things, so are object pointers and function pointers

-C is a call by value language, which means when provide an argument to a function, the value
of that argument is copied into a distinct variable, for use within the function.

-When used in a function declaration or definition, * act as part of a pointer declarator
indicating that the parameter is a pointer to an object function of a specific type.

-When you use * in expressions within the function, the * operator dereferences the pointer to the object

- & is the 'address-of' operator, which generates a pointer to its operand.

=================================
STORAGE DURATION
=================================
- Objects have a storage duration that determines their lifetime. Altogether, four storage duration are available:
automatic, static, thread, and allocated.

- objects of automatic storage duration are declared within a block or as a function parameter
the lifetime of these objects begins when the block in which they're declared begins execution,
and ends when the execution of the block ends. if the block is entered recursively, a new object 
is created each time, each with its own storage.

-Objects declared in file scope have static storage duration. The lifetime of these objects is 
the entire execution of the program, their stored value is initialized to program startup.

- You can also use the specifier 'static', within a block scope to give static storage duration to a variable.
These objects persist after the function has exited.

- Thread storage duration is used in concurrent programming.

- allocated storage duration deals with dynamically allocated memory.

=================================
ALIGNMENT
=================================
-Object types have alignment requirements that place restrictions on the addresses 
at which objects of that type may be allocated. 

-An aligment represents the number of bytes between successive addresses at which a 
given  object can be allocated

-alignments are represented as values of the type 'size_t'. Every valid alignment value is 
a nonnegative integral power of two.

- An object type imposes a default aligment requirement on every object of that type: a stricter
aligment (a larger power of two) can be requested using the aligment specifier(_Alignas).   

=================================
STRUCTS
=================================
- Structs contain sequentially allocated member objects. Each object has its own name and may have a distinct type
unlike arrays, which must all be of the same type.

- structs are useful for declaring collections of related objects and represent things like, a customer, or
personnel record.

- are especially useful for grouping objects that are frequently passed together as arguments to a function,
so you don't have to pass individual objects separately.

- can use -> to point to one of its members

=================================
UNIONS
=================================
-similar to structures, except that the memory used by the member objects overlaps.

-Unions can contain an object of one type at one time, and an object of a different type at a different time,
but never both objects at the same time. primarily used to save memory.

=================================
TYPE QUALIFIERS
=================================
-Three type Qualifies const, volatile, restrict 

-const makes a variable constant, unchangeable without errors. You can do some workarounds to change a const
variable but it is not reccommended.

-volatile. Static volatile qualified objects are used to model memory-mapped input/output(I/O) ports,
and static constant volatile-qualified objects model memory-mapped input ports such as a real-time clock.
    -Values stored in volatile objects may change without the knowledge of the compiler. for example, every time
    the value from a real time clock is read, it may change, even if the value has not been to by the c program.
    using a volatile type lets the compiler know that the value may change, and ensures that every access to the
    real-time clock occurs

-restrict-qualified pointers are used to promote optimizations.

-object frequently cannot be fully optimized because of potential aliasing, which occurs when more than one pointer
refers to the same object. aliasing can inhibit optimizations, because the compiler can't tell if portions of an object
can change values when another apparently unrelated object is modified.
    -you must ensure that the pointers do not refer to overlapping memory to prevent undefined behavior.


=================================
ARITHMETIC TYPES
=================================
-All integer types except char, signed char, unsigned char may contain unused bit called padding.

-Padding allows implementations to accommodate hardware quirks such as skipping over a sign bit in the middle of a 
multi word representation, or to optimally align with a target architecture

-the number of bits used to represent a value of a given type, excluding padding but including the sign, is called
the 'WIDTH', often denoted as N.

'PRECISION' is the number of bits used to represent values, excluding sign and padding bits.

-<limits.h> header file provides the min and max representable value for various integer types.
    -representable values are ones that can be represented in the number of bits available
    to an object of that type.

-Values that cannot be represented will be diagnosed by the compiler or converted to a representable
but different (incorrect) value

-max, min and width values are determined by compilers.

-integers are by default signed, except char, chars you can declare as signed or unsigned,
ints you can only declare unsigned or omit.

-'WRAPAROUND' occurs when you perform arithmetic operations that result in values too small or too large
to be represented as a particular unsigned integer type. the value essentially either rollsover to the max or min values
of the type
